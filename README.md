# A Place to Store Spine & Other Book Data

## About
I'm doing this primarily for the sake of self-learning, so some of the decisions I make may be sub-optimal. The crux of this applicaiton is that it will store book data, including references to images of spines and covers. My inspiration is other resources like the open source library, but I'm especially interested in providing and API for spine images.
